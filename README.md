# slush-theme-patterns

> A Slush generator for the WordPress Theme Pattern Library.


## Getting Started

Slush is built on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/). In order to get up and running, you will first need to make sure these are installed globally.

You can head over to the Node.js homepage and install the latest version from there (the green "INSTALL" button). That will give you both Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager).

Once you have Node installed, you can install the global dependencies (Gulp and [Slush](https://github.com/slushjs/slush)) with the following command:

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp slush
```

Additionally, this generator takes advantage of Sass for a couple one-off compiling tasks.

If you're on a Mac, you can install that Sass locally with the following:

```bash
$ gem install sass
```

OR the following, if you get a permissions error:

```bash
$ sudo gem install sass
```

A more in-depth set of instructions can be found at the official [Sass docs](http://sass-lang.com/install).

Lastly, you will need to install the generator itself, via the following command:

```bash
$ npm install -g slush-theme-patterns
```

*If you are receiving a permissions error, you may need to run these installation commands as `sudo`. For example, `sudo npm install -g gulp`.

Now, you're ready to use the generator.

### Usage

Anywhere *outside* of the Slush generator folder, create a new folder for your project:

```bash
$ mkdir my-new-project
```

Run the generator from within the new folder:

```bash
$ cd my-new-project && slush theme-patterns
```

## Getting To Know Slush

Slush is a tool that uses Gulp for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with liftoff.
